\chapter{Rotations in space}

The group $O(3)$ of rotations in a three-dimensional space is of great importance in mathematical physics. In this chapter, this group will be studied in general and the irreducible representations will be discussed. This leads to a development of certain properties of some of the special functions of mathematical physics; these are the Jacobi polynomials with their special cases of Legendre polynomials and associated Legendre functions.

The representations of the rotation group can be obtained easily by establishing a homomorphic mapping of $SU(2)$ onto $O(3)$; it can then be shown that certain representations of $SU(2)$ are also representations of $O(3)$.

The representations of $O(3)$ can also be constructed in invariant subspaces of the space of functions defined in three-dimensional space. It will be shown that the suitable invariant subspaces are composed of harmonic, homogeneous polynomials in three variables. In this way the connection between the group representations and Laplace's equation can be established. We will also consider and solve the partial differential equations that the representations are required to satisfy because of the group structure.
