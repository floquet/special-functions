\section[Differential equations for the group representations]{Differential equations for the \\\qquad \ group representations}

It was shown in Section \S\eqref{sec:6-10} that the representations of a Lie group must satisfy the partial differential equations \eqref{6-52}. In this section we will obtain these equations for the representations $\D^{'l}(R)$ of the rotation group. This task is again complicated by the singularity in the Euler angle coordinate system at the identity, so that
